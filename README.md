## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- SCSS (or SASS)
- Flex Box

### What I learned

I learned a lot about flex box and css in general. I was always scared of css and always just used bootstrap to save myself from css. But now I have gathered enough courage and now I am trying to make some layouts with css. If this project seems bad, please don't roast me. Its only been like 2 weeks since I have started actually making projects with css. I earlier just knew some css properties but never actually used them.

### Continued development

I am still very new to css and I have yet to learn a lot more things like animations, grids, better responsive UI, etc.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) helped me a lot to lookup some properties I forgot and to lookup new properties that I discovered.
